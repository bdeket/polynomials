# polynomials

Small library for working with polynomials.

Works with exact, flonum, extflonum and bigfloats in the real and complex domain.
Implements evaluation, basic operations and some root finding algorithms.

When stable, the intention is to merge it into the math library.

If you have any sugestions or comments on code, style, functions etc., please let me know.
